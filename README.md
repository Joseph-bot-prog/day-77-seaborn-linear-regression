Day-77

Today's topic was Seaborn which was wonderfully explained by Angela Yu.

What did I learn?

Use nested loops to remove unwanted characters from multiple columns

Filter Pandas DataFrames based on multiple conditions using both .loc[] and .query()

Create bubble charts using the Seaborn Library

Style Seaborn charts using the pre-built styles and by modifying Matplotlib parameters

Use floor division (i.e., integer division) to convert years to decades

Use Seaborn to superimpose a linear regressions over our data

Make a judgement if our regression is good or bad based on how well the model fits our data and the r-squared metric

Run regressions with scikit-learn and calculate the coefficients.

Project of the day

Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank MYSELF for being self-motivated throughout the lecture.
